## What is Text Classification?

Text Classification is a process of classifying data in the form of text such as tweets, reviews, articles, blogs, etc... into predefined categories. Sentiment analysis is a special case of Text Classification where users’ opinion or sentiments about any product are predicted from textual data.

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis(Opinion mining) is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase. There can be other forms of sentiment analysis or opinion mining like predicting rating scale on product’s review, predicting polarity on aspects of a product, detecting subjectivity and objectivity in sentences etc.

Sentiment analysis helps data analysts within large enterprises gauge public opinion, conduct nuanced market research, monitor brand and product reputation, and understand customer experiences. In addition, data analytics companies often integrate third-party sentiment analysis APIs into their own customer experience management, social media monitoring, or workforce analytics platform, in order to deliver useful insights to their own customers.

## How does sentiment analysis work?

### The basics

Basic sentiment analysis of text documents follows a straightforward process:

    Break each text document down into its component parts (sentences, phrases, tokens and parts of speech)
    Identify each sentiment-bearing phrase and component
    Assign a sentiment score to each phrase and component (-1 to +1)
    Optional: Combine scores for multi-layered sentiment analysis
